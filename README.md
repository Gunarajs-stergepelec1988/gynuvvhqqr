OMG, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Until Dawn and wow, my brain is a swirl of emotions right now. That game is like a chaotic rollercoaster, I swear. Man, the jump scares got me a couple of times, definitely not gonna lie about that. I mean, seriously, why do they have to go up to that creepy-as-hell cabin in the first place? Haven't these people 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 horror  s? Sheesh.

And the plot twists! Freaking nuts how twisted things get. You're there thinking it’s a simple slasher scenario nope, surprise... supernatural stuff! Like, PLOT TWIST of the century with the Wendigos. How did I not see that coming??? Thank god I decided to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   version just to see all the madness unfold again. 

> But honestly, I was so mad with that Josh character. Like, dude, you gotta chill! His storyline is a whole crazy mess. I felt for him, truly, but still... pulling your friends into your drama on that scale is just wrong, man. And the tension with those timed decisions?? I was legit sweating at times, my heart racing because making choices under pressure is NOT my vibe. Haha. I guess that's why I was like, “𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   to a friend instead of playing, because cringing at their jumps is hilarious.

Who plans a getaway in the middle of a snowstorm? Just feed me marshmallows by the fire and let me drink hot cocoa instead, thanks. Or whatever, I don’t know… perhaps I’m old but I’d never sign up for that. It’s madness. OH! And Ashley and Chris... their dynamic is so fun to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩, kinda funny, but damn if it isn't a bit cliché at times.

Why are Wendigos even a thing??! The way they move is nightmare fuel. Ugh. Makes you think twice about camping trips. Anyway, I know I’m rambling, whatever, the whole thing was pretty dope and I’m probably babbling ‘cause my mind’s still in overdrive, but I loved/hated the chaos.

And to wrap it up, Sarah, we need to have a freaky Friday. Let's replay and this time YOU make the decisions, so I can relax and just laugh at your panic face. 😂 Later gater!
